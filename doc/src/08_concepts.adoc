== Cross-cutting Concepts

=== Interoperability
Communication between microservices is essential. Likewise the communication format, the protocol, is essential and absolutely required to
use a well-defined structure that both communication partners, provider and consumer, understand.

Three kind of communication formats must be considered.

[#informtion-data]
==== Information Data
The actual transferred business payload between two services is the common case of microservice communication. The service provider is in
the role of upstream service and feeds all consuming services (aka. downstream services). *Hence the provider narrows the protocol and data
structures that are possible for the communication*. But the consumer may choose between options, like different representation formats
(JSON, XML, vendor specific, etc.) or transport protocols.

The consumer is responsible to transform the received structures into it’s own internal used data structures. This often happens in a
so-called ACL (Anti Corruption layer).

==== Context Data
Beside the actual business payload context relevant information must be transmitted as part of each microservice communication. For example
this is relevant to trace calls within a call chain and particular to support operationability and monitoring of a distributed system.

This contextual data is not specific to each microservice, like information data is, but has to follow a common structure that is applied in
every microservice implementation. Each microservice acts as consumer and additional as producer, respectively enricher, of context data.
Finally the transferred information must be sufficient to feed external monitoring systems with.

*Context data of OpenWMS microservices is transferred in headers, either HTTP headers or RabbitMQ headers*.

For example: When OpenWMS.org microservices are deployed in a multi-tenant environment the tenant identifier is required with each call.
This information is typical context data that needs to be transferred between client and server. For a HTTP call the tenant identifier is
propagated as custom HTTP header `X-Tenant` and for asynchronous AQMP messages the AMQP header `osip_tenant` transfers this information.

==== Failure Data
In failure situations a microservice might not respond with self-defined information data structure but with failure or error responses. The
structure and the protocol of these error responses must be consist across all microservices in order to establish communication even in
case of errors. As an example: It is not an option that Service A returns an error response to Service B that cannot be processed by
Service B because the protocol or format is unknown to Service B.

With OpenWMS we use Spring Boot as implementation framework. Spring Boot already comes with it’s own format like it exposes errors to API
consumers. For REST API over HTTP a typical Spring Boot error response looks like this:

[source,json]
----
{
    "timestamp": 1568208641323,
    "status": 500,
    "error": "Internal Server Error",
    "exception": "org.ameba.oauth2.InvalidTokenException",
    "message": "JWT expired at 2019-09-11T13:30:41Z. Current time: 2019-09-11T13:43:27Z",
    "path": "/transport-units/S000005270119225"
}
----

This works well with Spring Boot consumers on the client side. Even clients in JavaScript can deal with this format. *The problem here is,
that the format is baked into and driven by Spring Boot and may change between mayor framework releases*.

Therefor a RFC was initiated, the Problem Details for HTTP APIs (RFC7807). By applying this RFC to all OpenWMS microservice implementations
we ensure that we align to a standardized but flexible and extendable format.

[source,json]
----
{
    "type": "https://api.openwms.dev/meta/v1/error/AlreadyExistsException",
    "title": "AlreadyExistsException",
    "status": 500,
    "detail": "The TransportUnit with Barcode [S000005270119225] already exists and cannot be created",
    "messageKey": "E0033",
    "messageLanguage": "en-US",
    "messageCategory": "ERROR",
    "args": ["S000005270119225"],
    "call": {
        "headers": {

            "x-trace-id": "1210be13194bfe5"
        },
        "uri": "https://api.openwms.dev/v1/transport-units/S000005270119225",
        "path": "/transport-units/S000005270119225",
        "method": "POST"
    }
    "timestamp": 1568208641323,
    "error": "Internal Server Error",
    "exception": "org.ameba.oauth2.InvalidTokenException",
    "message": "JWT expired at 2019-09-11T13:30:41Z. Current time: 2019-09-11T13:43:27Z"
}

==== Communication Structures
This chapter describes how microservices communicate between each other. Basically two communication patterns are used:

* synchronous communication with REST API and
* asynchronous communication via RabbitMQ message broker

In all REST API the DTO (Data Transfer Objects) are called VO (View Objects), like the `LocationVO`, `LocationGroupVO` etc. These type of
classes may include hypermedia links, JSON mapping annotation etc. All those things handy for communication over HTTP.

When microservices use asynchronous messaging, the proposed data format over the wire is JSON, but also a byte array stream is possible.
JSON is better suited because it is independent from the microservice implementation technology and can be read by any language like Java,
.NET, C and many others.

In all microservices built with Java, the data structures are MO (Message Objects) that are exchanged between parties. A MO is a simple DTO
that encapsulates relevant data, like the `LocationMO`.

On consumer side the MO as well as VO need to be translated into internal structures and must not be used internally (see <<informtion-data,chapter about ACL>>)

A microservice may use internal synchronous eventing through out the Spring `ApplicationContext`. The events used internally must not be
propagated to the outside of the microservice and must be converted into a MO or VO first.

=== Error Handling in Distributed Systems
In a distributed system we must ensure that failure situations across the network are handled properly without impacting the robustness nor
performance of the whole system negatively. A technical error handling can often be done with libraries, like Hystrix, resilience4j, feign
or others. Also Spring AMQP cares about and offers different strategies to deal with errors. But it is not always possible to handle
failures in one standardized and automated way. At least, we need to decide what failure resolution strategy from one of those libraries is
chosen in case of an error.

==== Error Handling with Asynchronous AMQP Messaging
Spring AMQP with RabbitMQ is used for the asynchronous messaging infrastructure. A publisher sends a message to an AMQP Exchange where a
consumer process has connected a AMQP Queue to. A message is sent to the Exchange and published to one or more connected Queues. If a
consumer fails to process the queued message it has several possibilities to react: Re-Queue, Throw-Away or Forward.

**Re-Queuing failed Messages**
In case of re-queueing the message is left in the queue and executed again. How often this happens and with what interval can be configured.

**Throw-Away failed Messages**
Simply omit the error occurred and be silent could also be a consumer strategy. In this case the message is acknowledged to RabbitMQ and is
gone from the queue - but without handling the message as demanded.

**Forward failed Messages**
A consumer could also decided to forward a message it could not process to someone else or to just forward it into a message store without
knowing about the consumers of that store - there might actually be no consumer. This pattern in basically called https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/DeadLetterChannel.html[Dead-Letter Queueing]
and also RabbitMQ offers this technique.

The list of strategies is for sure not complete but enough for what we need in OpenWMS.org. So here is a short comparison of these three
strategies in relation to the use in OpenWMS.org:
[cols="1,2,3" options="header"]
|===
| Strategy    | Advantage | Disadvantage
| Re-Queueing | The message is not lost. It stays in the queue even after the consumer gets updated or restarted. | May slow down the system
cause of repetition. Blocks other messages in the queue from being processed
| Throw-Away  | Processing other messages goes on, the queue is not blocked | The thrown away message is lost but might be worth to know for
consumers. Throwing it away may lead to data inconsistencies
| Forward     | Processing other messages goes on, the queue is not blocked, the message is not lost | The process of handling this kind of
failed messages must be defined and handling them must be established. May lead to problems when a message sequence is expected (e.g. OSIP
UPDX telegrams must be processed and acknowledged before any other telegram can take place)
