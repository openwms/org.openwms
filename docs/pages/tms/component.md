## TMS - Transportation

This is a software component implemented in a polyglot microservice architecture. It is in that self-contained that 
it targets a business functionality and contains all application layers necessary to implement that function. The
only accessible interface is the public API defined and implemented by the microservice implementation.

### Functional Scope

The Transportation component offers essential functionality used to monitor and control transport orders established
in a warehouse. Those can be kind of manual or automatic ones.
